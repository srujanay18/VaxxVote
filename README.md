## Map of the Documentation

Make an H2 (##) section explaining the contents of the repository ● Section 1: Software and platform section ○ The type(s) of software you used for the project. ○ The names of any add-on packages that need to be installed with the software. ○ The platform (e.g., Windows, Mac, or Linux) you used. ● Section 2: A Map of your documentation. In this section, you should provide an outline or tree illustrating the hierarchy of folders and subfolders contained in your Project Folder, and listing the files stored in each folder or subfolder. ● Section 3: Instructions for reproducing your results. In this section, you should give explicit step-by-step instructions to reproduce the Results of your study. These instructions should be written in straightforward plain English, but they must be concise, but detailed and precise enough, to make it possible for an interested user to reproduce your results without much difficulty. N.B. This section will be crucial for the CS1 assignment, where you'll be required to reproduce the results of other groups. Therefore, make sure to explain this section thoroughly.
